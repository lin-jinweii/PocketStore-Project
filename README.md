# PocketStore Project

This project (mobile application) designed is to help users to loan and donate items easily. At the same time, the manager will have the ability whether to approve, 
extend the loan as well as the donation. The key features of the project are as follows:

Users:
- Request for loans and extension of loans
- Request to donate items

Manager:
- Approve/Reject loans and extension of loans
- Approve/Reject the donation of items

There are some considerations to note for the project:
- No sign up as the manager will be the one creating the account for user (school based)
- No log out as only one account per person and prevent helping to log in for others
